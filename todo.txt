- Load Balancing:
so multiple Provider nodes can host the same Service ID.
The Gateway can then load-balance between them using Round Robin or Least Connections algorithms to improve resilience.


1. Add Load Balancing
Currently picks first instance. Could add:
    -Round-robin selection
    -Health checks
    -Least-connections algorithm

- Health Checks:
 Implement a mechanism where the Provider node regularly checks if the local Docker container is responsive.
 If it fails, the Provider should unpublish its Service ID from the DHT.


2.Add Service Health Monitoring
	-Periodic health checks of advertised services
	- Automatic removal of unhealthy instances
	-Service status endpoints

-	HTTPS/TLS: Moving from http to https for the end-user.
	 Add TLS/HTTPS Support
    -TLS termination at gateway
	-Let's Encrypt integration
	-Service-to-service encryption
    
-	Multi-Tenancy: Deploying multiple Docker containers and ensuring the DHT routes to the right one every time.

3. Add Authentication/Authorization
    -API keys for gateway access
    -Service-level permissions
	-Rate limiting

- Scheduler 
Next, you need a scheduler that decides
Which peer should run a task

Based on:
Capability match
Current load
Latency

Price (later)
Think of this as:
“Given a job, who’s the best node right now?”
This does not belong in main.go.
This becomes a separate internal service:
